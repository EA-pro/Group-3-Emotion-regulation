  flow_greeting_and_selecting_current_emotional_state:
    description: >
      Emotional check-in flow for children. This flow is used when the child greets
      the assistant and should be guided to choose an emoji that reflects their
      current emotional state. The assistant then acknowledges and reflects the
      selected feeling in a calm and supportive manner.
    steps:
      # Step 0) Reset mood slot at flow start
      - set_slots:
        - mood: null

      # Step 1) Send supportive message first, then intro (with emoji buttons),
      # then listen for the user's choice. Using `action_listen` lets the
      # intent/rule mapping handle the button press directly and trigger the
      # specific `utter_reflect_mood_<mood>` responses.

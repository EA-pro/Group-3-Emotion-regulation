Subject: Common anger triggers at home
Last updated: January 2026

At home, children often feel angry when:
- A brother or sister takes their things without asking
- Parents say “no” to something that feels very important to them
- There are many rules, but they do not understand the reason
- Adults are busy on their phone and do not seem to listen
- There is a lot of noise, shouting or stress in the house

These situations can feel unfair or overwhelming.
Anger then tries to protect you, but it is still important to stay safe.
Talking, asking for a pause or going to a quiet place can be more helpful than slamming doors or yelling.

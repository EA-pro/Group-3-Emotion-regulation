Subject: Expressing anger in a safe way
Last updated: January 2026

It is okay to feel angry, but it is not okay to hurt yourself, hurt others or break things on purpose.
Here are safer ways to show anger:
- Use “I-feel” sentences, like “I feel angry when you talk over me” instead of shouting.
- Write your feelings in a notebook or draw your anger as a colour or weather type.
- Squeeze a pillow or hit a cushion instead of hitting a person.
- Ask for a calm moment: “Can we talk about this later? I am too angry now.”

Safe expression helps other people understand you without becoming scared or defensive.

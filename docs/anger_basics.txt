Subject: What is anger?
Last updated: January 2026

Anger is a normal emotion that everyone feels sometimes.
Anger can show up in the body as a tight chest, a warm face, a fast heartbeat or fists that want to clench.
Anger is not a “bad” feeling, but it can lead to unhelpful behaviour if we hit, shout or hurt ourselves or others.
Anger often hides other feelings underneath, like feeling hurt, scared, embarrassed or left out.
It can help to notice: “My anger is telling me that something feels unfair or too much right now.”

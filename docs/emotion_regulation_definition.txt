Subject: What is emotion regulation?
Last updated: January 2026

Emotion regulation means noticing your feelings and choosing what to do with them in a helpful way.
It does not mean pushing feelings away or pretending they are not there.
Instead, it means:
- Naming the feeling (“I feel angry and disappointed.”)
- Calming your body so your brain can think again
- Choosing an action that is safe and fits your values, even when the feeling is strong

Children can learn emotion regulation with practice, just like a sport or a musical instrument.
It becomes easier when adults model calm behaviour and when you have a few simple strategies ready for moments of stress.

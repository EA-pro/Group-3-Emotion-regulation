Subject: Common anger triggers at school
Last updated: January 2026

Many children feel angry at school in situations like these:
- When someone laughs at them or calls them names
- When a friend ignores them or walks away without explaining why
- When a teacher seems unfair or does not listen to their side of the story
- When they get a lower grade than they hoped for, even after trying hard
- When other children push in front of them or do not follow the rules

It can be helpful to remember that feeling angry in these moments is understandable.
What matters most is what you choose to do with the anger.
You can learn calm ways to respond instead of exploding or keeping everything inside.

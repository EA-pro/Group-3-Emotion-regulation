Subject: Calming the body when angry
Last updated: January 2026

When anger feels strong, the body needs help to calm down.
Here are simple body-based strategies many children find helpful:
- 60-second breathing: breathe in gently through the nose for 4 counts, hold for 2, breathe out slowly through the mouth for 6 counts.
- Grounding with the 5–4–3–2–1 exercise: notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.
- Movement break: walk slowly to get a glass of water, stretch your arms and shoulders or squeeze a stress ball.
- Safe pause: ask for a short break, for example: “I need one minute to calm down, then we can talk.”

These strategies do not make the problem disappear, but they help your body move from “ready to fight” to “ready to think”.

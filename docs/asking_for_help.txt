Subject: Asking for help with big feelings
Last updated: January 2026

Sometimes anger and other feelings become too big to handle alone.
It is a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help.

Trusted people can include:
- Parents or caregivers
- Another family member you feel safe with
- A teacher, mentor or school counsellor
- A coach, youth worker or doctor

You can start small, for example:
“I have been feeling very angry lately and I do not know why.”
or
“Can I tell you something that is bothering me?”

If you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself or others, it is important to tell an adult immediately or contact emergency services or a child help line in your country.
You deserve support and safety.

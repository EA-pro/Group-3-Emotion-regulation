Subject: Calming thoughts when angry
Last updated: January 2026

Anger often brings very strong thoughts, like “Nobody likes me” or “This is always unfair.”
These thoughts can make the feeling even bigger.

It can help to:
- Name the thought: “I notice I am thinking that nobody likes me.”
- Gently question it: “Is this 100% true, or is it how my anger feels right now?”
- Find a more balanced thought, for example:
  - Instead of “Nobody listens to me”, try “Right now I feel unheard, but some people do care.”
  - Instead of “I always mess up”, try “I made a mistake this time, and I can learn from it.”
Small changes in thoughts can make the anger feel a little less heavy.
